How to get your own github academic website ?
---

This is simple (and free), just fork this repository : <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io" target="_blank">https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io</a> with your github account

Name your forked repository : (your-git-pseudo).github.io, make it public, and then you could see your own website on url https://(your-git-pseudo).github.io

You'll change the files as you want, there some help in the original repository that help you to know what file to change and how

This is a first naive blog post, I'll try to make better ones later...!
