Different ways to get to website
---

I have such naive view about web programming but all developpers have to deal with the CV website question. Althought we know how to manage HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/etc.. project, we have to find how to host such a website and to get a domain name. And which programming skills are needed ?

I managed to do some searches and asked some of my friends in order to find some solutions considering different issues. I'm going to talk about this different solutions but keep in mind that is such a naive list and that is not exhaustive, don't hesitate to do your searches !

#### Wix Website

It's a way for non-programmer to make their own free website. It's just some click-and-put mechanics to present texts and files. The bad points about this solution is that we have to pay to remove the publicity-header of Wix and to change the domain name of the website.

Here an example of this type of website (free version) : <a target="_blank" href="https://antoinenollet3.wixsite.com/presentation">https://antoinenollet3.wixsite.com/presentation</a>

Let see about the Wix website if you interested in : <a target="_blank" href="https://fr.wix.com/">https://fr.wix.com/</a>

#### Github Pages

Here it's a more programming way to get your own (free) website, it's about Github Pages. Github give a domain name and hosted website to all github users. But it's only one website per user (and it's still a good thing !) and you quite not decide you domain name (because you choose your username but not the github page pattern).

You could set a public repository named [your github username].github.io and then develop your website as you want. You can look at github dedicated page about it : <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</a>

There some templates on github whose you can fork in order to access faster to a website. There is the academic template that I already talked about in <a target="_blank" href="https://the-gtn.github.io/posts/2024/08/blog-post-1/">my previous blog post</a> that is an example of it. You can look at the dedicated page about it : <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io">https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io</a>

#### Vercel

An other example of solution that only requires having a account. It's vercel website that can be deployed with github. You can only have one free domain name with free account. This type of solution is optimized for angular or typescript but quite work with all techno you like (why not html/css/js). I didn't try it but here an example what a friend of mine did with it : <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iamludal.fr/">https://www.iamludal.fr/</a>

You could look at the Vercel website to get into this solution : <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/">https://vercel.com/</a>

#### Pelican

Here a static site generator python powered that a teacher of mine advised me that I didn't try yet : <a target="_blank" href="https://getpelican.com/">https://getpelican.com/</a>. But you'll have to find hosting and domain name, here it's just about static sites.

#### OVH

Here the classic not free solutions. OVH is a hosting services and can provide you domain name for different prices : <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/web-hosting/">https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/web-hosting/</a>. It's not the only one, it's an example of what exist and there a lot of not free services for hosting websites.

#### Wordpress

Wordpress is a solution about web content management and there is many ways to host wordpress websites like said in previous section. 

Here the wikipedia page about this : <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress</a>

And an example of wordpress managed website : <a target="_blank" href="https://auptitdetail.fr/">https://auptitdetail.fr/</a>

#### Yunohost

And the final solution is about self-hosting, it's quite a good-learning experience for all programmers even if it's not a simple task. There is yunohost, a free open-source software, that help you about self-hosting : <a target="_blank" href="https://yunohost.org/#/">https://yunohost.org/#/</a>

It was quite a naive list but I hope it you found it interesting ! I'm still learning and I advise you and myself to stay informed of what exist because we should be always learning !
